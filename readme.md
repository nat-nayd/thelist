## The List: a hero's quest to learning Laravel

[![v1.0](https://travis-ci.org/laravel/framework.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/laravel/framework)

This is a simple application, built on Laravel that provides a backend with authentication and a RESTful api for handling resources to a random frontend (such as one built on Ember.js for example)

## Official Laravel Documentation

Documentation for the entire framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).

### ToDo
*Backend additions:*
* Add Pagination
* Add filters
* Add sorting

*Frontend*
* Build a SPA frontend with Ember.js

**All issues and pull requests should be filed on the [laravel/framework](http://github.com/laravel/framework) repository.**
